# SpeedyGo

SpeedyGo is a framework to develop and evaluate race prediction algorithms. It includes a comprehensive benchmark to compare different algorithms in terms of false positives and false negatives.

## Usage

To run one of the benchmark tests with the W3PO algorithm, we use the following command:

```
go run main.go -mode w3po -trace ../benchmark/Test1.log
```
